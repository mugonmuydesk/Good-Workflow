# Project Context

## 📚 MANDATORY: Read All Documentation First

**Before proceeding with any development work, you MUST read all project documentation:**

1. **`README.md`** - Project overview and features
2. **`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`** - Workflow rules and implementation phases  
3. **`FILES.md`** - Complete file index with purposes
4. **`context.md`** - This file: current project state

These documents form the complete project specification and workflow guidelines.
